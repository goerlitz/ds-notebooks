Demonstration of capabilities of Data Science Notebooks.

# Quick Start

The notebooks can be easily started via a pre-configured virtual machine.


1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (optionally on Windows: install GitShell or similar)
2. Open a command line tool in the base directory (containing `Vagrantfile`) and run `vagrant up`. Setting up the virtual machine may take a while as images for the VM and docker are downloaded.
3. Access [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your web browser
